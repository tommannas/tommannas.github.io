## Project 1: [EXCEL] Coffee Data Dashboard
Please click 'view raw file' to download the spreadsheet & enable editing to make the dashboard interactive!
Used 'XLOOKUP' and 'INDEX MATCH' functions to gather data in one sheet. Using filters, formatting & 'IF' function to clean the data and make new columns for our data. Then inserted a PivotTable with a TimeLine and Slicers with graphs for 'Top 5 Customers' and 'Sales by Country'.
Put all this together in one sheet for the interactive dashboard that is easy to use and delivers insights at the user's discretion.
